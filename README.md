# SpringBootMicroService_CloudConfigServer_Utility
This is the implementation of cloud config server using a utility project. 
Three Services are made(DeptService,EmpService, Calling Service).
All of them interact with each other using rest calls.
The common configuration is kept at common place and loaded using spring cloud config server.

Just import the project using maven build and run the servies in STS. You are good to go.
